## Project Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focusing on tasks related to data preprocessing and cleaning:

1. **Task 1: "Data Cleaning and Preprocessing"**
   - Purpose: Data cleaning and outlier correction.
   - Key Components:
     - Mounting Google Drive to access data.
     - Identifying and correcting outliers in datasets.
     - Libraries used: `pandas`, `numpy`, and others.

2. **Task 2: "Data Loading and Cleaning Workflow"**
   - Purpose: Data loading and initial cleaning workflow.
   - Key Components:
     - Mounting Google Drive to load datasets.
     - Basic data cleaning operations such as handling missing values.
     - Libraries used: `pandas`, `numpy`, and others.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: 
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (if visualization is included)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
- Open the notebooks in Jupyter or any compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab).
- Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the cells in sequence.
